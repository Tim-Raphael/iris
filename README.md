# `ðŸª» Iris`

**A user-friendly interface that lets you remotely control small cars.**

</div>

## ðŸš§ Key Features
This project is still under development, but it already supports the following
feartures:

- starting the WebRTC signaling process and rendering the incoming stream
- registration as a User or Device
- connecting to a Device

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
You can start up this project by running `nix-shell` alternatively you could: 

```bash
cd web/
pnpm run dev
cd ../iris/
cargo run
``` 

## ðŸ’» Structure 
The entire application based around web sockets. You can register
either as a [Device](#device) or [User](#user). When registered the 
ConnectionServer keeps track of your current state and all connections between 
the User(1) and Devices(n).

### Commands
This application is structured around commands. Each participant can send and
receive commands via their ws connection. The ConnectionServer handles these 
commands.

<details>
<summary>ServerCommand</summary>

These are the commands the ConnectionServer can handle, but most of them are not
directly send by the user or device. The registration of a user, for example, is 
done by the `user_ws_hander`.

### Entites

#### Device 
Devices can be registered under 
[http://127.0.0.1:8080/signaling/register/device/{device_name}](http://127.0.0.1:8080/signaling/register/device/{device_name}), 
which opens a ws connection between the Device and the server. As soon as a
Device is registered, a User can `Connect` to the Device, which means that the 
Device is only available to that specific User.

#### User
The User is registered under 
[http://127.0.0.1:8080/signaling/register/user](http://127.0.0.1:8080/signaling/register/user), 
which opens a ws connection between the User and the server. Users are able to
`Connect` to devices, send `Request` to initiate the WebRTC connection 
process.
